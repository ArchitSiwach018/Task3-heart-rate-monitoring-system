Heart rate, body temperature and blood pressure monitoring are very important parameters of human body. Doctors use various kind of medical apparatus like thermometer for checking fever or body temperature, BP monitor for blood pressure measurement and heart rate monitor for heart rate measurement. In this project, we have built an Arduino based heartbeat monitor which counts the number of heartbeats in a minute. Here we have used a heartbeat sensor module which senses the heartbeat upon putting a finger on the sensor.

Components
1. Arduino
2. Heart Beat sensor module
3. 16x2 LCD
4. Push button
